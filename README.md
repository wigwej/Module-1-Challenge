## Analysis of Louise's crowdfunding

**Overview** 
*** An upcoming playwriter is looking to crowdfund her play Fever, whch has an estimated budget of over $10,000. Louise came short of her fundraising goal for her play Fever. She seeks to find out how other campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals and meausres to take to achieve her goal.

**Analysis and Challenges**
***how analysis was performed and challenges encountered?
In order to assist Louise, we examined data set of campaigns across different categories and subcategories, the countries where the campaigns were held and the currencies, the goals per campaign and the amount pledged, the number of backers, the length and months of campaigns, the outcomes per campaign, the spotlight and the staff pick per campaign.
*** Perecentage funded***We calculated percentage funded to determine how much of campaign goals were met and how close a campaign came to meeting or exceeding its goals.
We highlighted the outcomes to reveal the successful, failed, canceled and live campaigns. 
On rearranging pledge data, we found that ....... was the most pledged and had ..... backers
*** Average donation***WE calcuated average donations of pledge in relation to backers and found that....
*** Country*** We examined the countries to see if the origin of the country had an impact on the success of the campaigns.
***Timing*** / Outcome based on Launch date. We tried to determine teh correlation between length of campaigna and its success to assess whether a campaign should be short or long for more effectiveness.
also are there periods a campaign is more successful?
***Unique campaigns*** and edinbugh research. we examined unique campaigns to see if some were similar to Lousise's vision. we examined  Foresight, Be prepared, Walken in Sunshine, Jesia and 
***Measures of central tendency/ descriptive sttaistices" Recognising that it is mores useful to Louise to use actual calculations such as mean, median, mode to assess the data
***meausres of spread*** such as range, standard devistion, variance to dteremine how far the camapaign is from the mean. We used the box and whiskers to dtermine the upper quaartile, lower quaruile and the inter quartuke range and to identify and eliminate outliers.

***Challenges***

**Results**
conclusions in Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
**Conclusions frpm Outcome based on Goals
***limitations of te dataset
The dataset is widely varied across different categories. There is a difficukty of selecting a representative category.
Chances of bias depending on choice of sample location. 
Need for more specific knoweledge of the nature of the play "Fever" for better compasrison. No clear understaning of there is a correlation between the nature of the type of play and the funds pledged.Data provided was limited to pledge and goals
what other possible tables/graphs could we create?
We could create a pie chart to compare proportions of funding per category; or a scatter plot to display values of two comaparative categories such as theatres and plays. We could also use a histogram to chart funding per category.
