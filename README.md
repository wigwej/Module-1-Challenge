## Analysis of Louise's crowdfunding

**Overview** 
*** An upcoming playwriter is looking to crowdfund her play Fever, whch has an estimated budget of over $10,000. Louise came short of her fundraising goal for her play Fever. She seeks to find out how other campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals and meausres to take to achieve her goal.

**Analysis and Challenges**
***how analysis was performed and challenges encountered?
In order to assist Louise, we examined data set of campaigns across different categories and subcategories, the countries where the campaigns were held and the currencies, the goals per campaign and the amount pledged, the number of backers, the length and months of campaigns, the outcomes per campaign, the spotlight and the staff pick per campaign.

*** Perecentage funded***We calculated percentage funded to determine how much of campaign goals were met and how close a campaign came to meeting or exceeding its goals.
We highlighted the outcomes to reveal the successful, failed, canceled and live campaigns. 
On rearranging pledge data, we found that campaigns in the US ranked higher in success than those in GB and was the most pledged was over $100000 and ahigh number of backers. Louise might wish to look more into the US for crowd funding.


*** Average donation***WE calcuated average donations of pledge in relation to backers and found that most backers were in US.


*** Country*** We examined the countries to see if the origin of the country had an impact on the success of the campaigns. We couldnt find a clear correlation. The tining appears to be of more significance. However US campaigns appear to have a lot more backers than those of GB and more successful funding of more expensive campaigns.


***Timing*** / Outcome based on Launch date. We tried to determine teh correlation between length of campaigna and its success to assess whether a campaign should be short or long for more effectiveness. Also are there periods a campaign is more successful? There appeared to be a positive correlation between campaigns launched in May/June and success rate. Also there was increase in success rate for camoaigns which lasted an average on one month.

***Unique campaigns*** and edinbugh research. we examined unique campaigns to see if some were similar to Lousise's vision. we examined Be prepared, Cutting Off Kate Bush,Jesia and Readon, Checkpoint 22. The Hitchhiker's Guide to Family. The goals of these campigns were ranged between $1500 to $4000 with 100% success rate. The HitchHiker's guide had the most backers of 113 with a goal of $4000. It would appear that contributions are made in smalll amounts. It appears to reinforce the need for a more conservative funding goal.


***Measures of central tendency and spread*** Recognising that it is mores useful to Louise to use actual calculations such as mean, median, mode to assess the data. The average successful goal was about $5000 while the median was $3000, with a standard deviation of over $7000; while the upper 25% of $5000 and  a lower 25% of $1500. the inyet quartile range was $3500. The amount pledged fell roughly within same range. Please refer to chart on descriptive statistics. The campaigns which failed had amost a double average funding goal and could only muster about a half in pledges.Louise should tailor her campaign closer to the mean. Please refer to the Box and Whiskers chart.
Only a few outliers needed to be eliminated from the data of value 1.5 times higher than the Interquartile range.

***Challenges***

**Results**
***conclusions in Theater Outcomes by Launch Date***

The largest number of campaigns took place in 2015. The most successful campaign was in summer of 2015 about the months of May and June. Also the most failed and canceled campaigns were within same period. The trends of succes/failure appear to correlate with the number of campaigns.However in 2017 there was a noose dive of the campaigns. However 2013 was highest percentage of success rate in relation to the total number of campaigns.The month of February ranked the highest success followed by May and June.
In general, Louise could tailor her campaign to fall within the summer months.

**Conclusions from Outcome based on Goals***
Most successful projects in relation to the total projects wre those below $5000. projects with goals between $35000-$45000 wre very few but had relative success. Lousie project had a greater chance of 100% success if it fell below the $5000 range.


***limitations of the dataset***
The dataset is widely varied across different categories. 
There is a difficulty of selecting a representative category.
Chances of bias depending on choice of sample location. 
Need for more specific knoweledge of the nature of the play "Fever" for better compasrison. No clear understaning of there is a correlation between the nature of the type of play and the funds pledged.Data provided was limited to pledge and goals.
Type of sampling method is unknown.


**what other possible tables/graphs could we create?**
We could create a pie chart to compare proportions of funding per category; or a scatter plot to display values of two comaparative categories such as theatres and plays. We could also use a histogram to chart funding per category.
A graph of country and amount pledged could be useful ti show impact of country on amount pledged.
